# InstaDogs - Redux

This project is a refactoring of the [Instadogs](https://github.com/julianachagas/instadogs) project using Redux to manage the global state.

In the original project, React's Context API was used to manage the global state and the shared data, such as the current authenticated user. In the refactoring process, we migrate the global state management to Redux.

In Redux, there is a single state object that's responsible for the global state of the application. The unidirectional data flow makes it easier to track state management and share data across different components.

The project is a social media app to share dogs' photos and it's the final project of the Redux with React course from [Origamid](https://www.origamid.com/curso/redux-com-react/), a Brazilian learning platform.
